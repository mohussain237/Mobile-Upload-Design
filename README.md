# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Project Overview,

This project implements a mobile-friendly PDF upload.
It simulates a real-world file upload workflow where a user selects a PDF, the system signs it using a mock API, and displays the result in a responsive viewer.
The UI adapts smoothly between desktop and mobile screens, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
